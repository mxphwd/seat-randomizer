Modern Seat Randomizer for Classrooms with 16 students. Design inspired by Apple Liquid Glass. (Mimicked using CSS)
Unlike **seat-mapper**, this application does not have the ability to select or modify seat layouts when results are out. To use this feature, consider using **seat-mapper** https://github.com/mxphwd/seat-mapper alongside this application.

Using **Visual Studio Code** or other code editing programs, open **students.json** file and change the default generic names.

Feedbacks are always welcome! 😊
