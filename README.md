Modern Seat Randomizer for Classrooms with 16 students. Design insipired by Apple Liquid Glass. (Mimicked on CSS)
Unlike **seat-mapper**, another application on this GitHub page, this application does not have the ability to select or modify seat layouts when results are out. To use this feature, consider using https://github.com/mxphwd/seat-mapper alongside this application.

Setup
Using **Visual Studio Code** or other code editing programs, open **students.json** file and change the default generic names.

Feedbacks are always welcome! 😊
